Explain the entire java life cycle.
A. First you write the source code using text editor. Then java compiler converts it into bytecodes, and .java gets converted into .class. After that it loads into Java virtual Machine then you get the output to the operating system.

what is class?
A. a class is a blueprint which determines how objects of that type will behave.

What is object?
A.is an instance of a class. The variable name is just the address in memory to where the object is stored.

What is the entry point of an application?
A. At the main method.

Why main is static?

A. java.lang.Object.

What is difference between path and classpath variables?
A. Path: is used to set the path for all Java software tools like javac.exe, java.exe, javadoc.exe, and so on.
   Classpath: is used to set the path for java classes.

What is the difference between an Interface and Abstract class?
A. Interface are absolutely abstract and cannot have implementations. However, an abstract class can have instance methods that implements a default behavior. Also, in a Java interface the variables declared is by default final, and the abstract class may contain non-final variables.

Can you make an Object from an Interface and Abstract class ? if not how do you use it ?
A. No, you can implement the Abstract class or interface in a new class, then create the object of this new class and use this object to your desire.

what is Access Specifier?
A. It regulate access to classes, fields and methods in Java. The Specifiers determine is a field or method in a class, can be used or invoked by another method in another class or sub-class.

What is OOP ? Define each feature of java OOP.
A. Object Oriented Programming.
   1. Abstraction: is process of hiding implementation from the user.
   2. Encapsulation: a mechanism of wrapping the data. Also, known as data hiding.
   3. Inheritance: a mechanism where a new class is derived from an existing class.
   4. Polymorphism: is the ability of an object to take on many form.

What is Java Package and which package is imported by default?
A. Is used to organize Java classes into namespaces similar, providing a unique namespace for each type it contains. It can be stored in compressed files called JAR files, and java.lang package is imported by default.

What is API? Name list of API that you have used so far.
A. Application programming interface, we mostly used JARs, and util.

Does java support multiple inheritance, explain why or why not?
A. No, because it leads to overriding of methods when the extended classes have a same method name.

What is method overloading and when it happens?
A. Is when a class has multiple methods with same name but different in parameters. It happens, when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.

Explain exceptions in java and how to handle it.
A. Is an event that occurs during compile time or runtime when a disrupt occurs in the code. In Java exceptions are handled by using a try catch block.

What is static keyword in java? How it has been used in variables and methods ?
A. Is a non-access modifier.
   The static variable can be used to refer to the common property of all objects . It gets memory only once in the class area at the time of class loading. it means that, it holds the last updated value to that variable.
   A static method is a method that can be called on a class and usually does not require the class to be instantiated. it can be used without creating an object.

What is final and how it has been used variables and methods?
A. Final is used to restrict the user. If you declare a final variable you cannot modified the variable. Same goes for method as well, if you declare final method you cannot modified it.

What is final, finally and finalize?
A. -final method cannot be be overridden and final class can't be inherited.
   -finally is executed in the end whether or not an exception occurs.
   -finalize is a method that is a garbage collector and can be used before Java's automatic garbage collector happens.

What is a constructor ?
A. Is a block of code similar to a method that's called when an instance of an object is created. Is a special method of a class, is used to initialize object.

Can we have multiple constructors in a class?
A. Yes, as long as its signature are not the same.

If we don't have a constructor declared, what is called during the object creation?
A. A default constructor will be called.

What is "this" keyword in java ?

What is the difference between JVM and JRE?
A. JVM is is used to compile Java source code. And, JRE provide runtime environment.

What is compile time and run time?
A. Compile time is the case where the code you entered is converted to executable, and Run time is the case where the executable is running

What is heap?
A. Is the runtime data area of RAM, where all class instances and arrays is allocated.

How java manage it's memory?

What is the difference between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder?

   StringBuffer is mutable, and can change the value of the object .
   StringBuilder stores the object in heap, and can also be modified.

What is Singleton class?
A. Is a class that can have only one object at a time.

What is Serialization and Deserialization?
A. Serialization is a way of converting the state of an object into a byte stream. And, Deserialization is the process of using byte stream to recreate the actual Java object in memory.

when to use transient variable in java?
A. When using serialization.

Difference between while and do..while loop?
A. A do-while loop doesn't check it's condition until the end of the loop but the while loop check's its condition first.

Why is String Immutable in Java?
A. Because, String objects are cached in String pool.

What is constructor chaining in Java?
A. The process of calling one constructor from another constructor with respect to current object.
